Best used with the Hadoop 1.0.x branch.

Usage: hadoop jar <jarfile> <ngramdir> <outdir> <phrase>

You'll need some amount of the Google n-gram dataset (from
http://books.google.com/ngrams/datasets ) in <ngramdir> and <outdir>
cannot already exist. All paths are of course in HDFS.

If you use the included Eclipse bits, you'll need to point Eclipse at the
Hadoop jars, and you'll want to modify the included jardesc to dump the jar
somewhere other than my home directory.

Output is a bunch of tab-separated values with anagrams and their frequencies.
If you really need to sort the output, you can use something like:

hadoop fs -cat <outdir>/part-* | sort -t"<tab char>" -k2
